# Pigeonhole

Pigeonhole lets you scrape emails of people present in a [Robin](https://robinpowered.com/) office by using the Robin API.

## How to run
Create an environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
You will need a Robin API access token and organisation ID to input into the app, which you get through the admin settings in the Robin interface.
